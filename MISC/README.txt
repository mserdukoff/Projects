These are assorted project that are less impressive and were from my first stages of learning Python
so I have put them here

Among these are:

italian.py
- just a simple program that gives me the time in italian, this was made in about 10 minutes during a 
clas so that I could memorize italian time-telling better

logging.py
- program that logs the runtime of a program, this was made a very long time ago

progressbar.py
- visualization of a terminal style progress bar

Benford's Law:
- I decided to make a program that counts the distribution of different digits and shows how it compares with
the expected distrubution of Benford's Law.
